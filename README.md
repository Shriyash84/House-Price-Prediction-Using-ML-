# House-Price-Prediction-Using-ML-

## Project Overview
The House Price Prediction Project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. The project utilizes regression algorithms to estimate property values, assisting buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

## Technologies Used
 - Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
 - Lot Area
- Year Built
- Number of Bedrooms
- Number of Bathrooms
- Garage Type
- Neighborhood
- Overall Condition
- Sale Price (target variable)

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the dataset and view model performance:
jupyter notebook House_Price_Prediction.ipynb

## Model Training
The model is trained using various regression algorithms such as:

 Linear Regression
 Decision Trees
 Random Forest  
 
The training process involves:
Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalization).
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Training the model and evaluating its performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Results
The final model achieved an RMSE of X on the test dataset. Detailed analysis and visualizations can be found in the notebook, showcasing feature importance and prediction distributions.
